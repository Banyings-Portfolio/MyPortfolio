                Here are some of the projects I have worked on and am still working on. I try to come up with new ideas to improve every day. I am eager to learn more from others and move forward. I am in love with software engineering, and I believe that the future is brighter with technology. Please visit my projects and give me some constructive feedback so I can improve, since there is no perfection in humans.
