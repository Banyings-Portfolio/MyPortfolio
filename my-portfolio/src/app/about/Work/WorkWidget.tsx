                I fell in love with Software Engineering when I started the course called Introduction to Programming. Although new and challenging for me at the beginning, I set a goal to improve myself and I knew that I would be able to feel comfortable coding one day. Now I am having fun coding and it is so cool for me, and I know that it is the same for every Software Engineer.</p>
